A demo notebook for Dow Jones News Fund data interns

During the week’s training, you will work on a project called Investigate Your Community to produce detailed story pitches relevant to their summer internship positions. The goal is to have the students research a topic relevant to your newsroom so they can get to work immediately at the internship. 

Here are some examples from last year’s DJNF data journalism training:

Hannah Rosenberger, at ASI Media/Counselor magazine, produced this analysis on name, image and likeness trends: https://hrosenberger.github.io/ASI-NIL-Project/

Shifra Dayak, an intern at the Connecticut Mirror, produced this analysis of environment spill data: https://shifradayak.github.io/DJNF_Merrill/ct_env_spills.html.

Michael Zhang, an intern at the Houston Landing, explored local election data: https://michaelzhangreporter.github.io/Houston_Campaign_Finance/

This notebook will show you how to build an economic profile of Houston and of Texas.

> **Learning Outcome:**. 
<br>
You will learn to how to retrieve and analyze employment and regional GDP data for their own counties or states and the steps to put it on a basic interactive charts. We will use Google Sheets and Datarapper. We will make a basic interactive map.

# Storytelling with Employment Data

Examine the Occupational Employment and Wage data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here's the report for May 2024 for Texas: https://data.bls.gov/oes/#/area/4800000
<br>

<br>  

<br>
**Questions**:  

    What is the median hourly wage for Chief Executives in Texas?

<br>  


```{r}

texas |> 
  filter(occ_title =="Chief Executives") |> 
  mutate(h_mean = as.numeric(h_mean)) |> 
  summarise(mean(h_mean, na.rm = TRUE) )


```


    What is the annual mean wage for Gambling Dealers in Texas?
    
```{r}

texas |> 
  filter(occ_title =="Gambling Dealers") |> 
  mutate(h_mean = as.numeric(h_mean)) |> 
  summarise(mean(h_mean, na.rm = TRUE) )

```

Here are the details about the data and the definitions:

email: oewsinfo@bls.gov	
	
	
Field	Field Description
area	State FIPS code
area_title	Area name 
naics	North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the given industry 
naics_title	North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) title for the given industry 
i_group	Contains the industry level: sector, 3-digit, 4-digit, 5-digit, or 6-digit NAICS
occ code	The 7-digit Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code, or OEWS specific code for the occupation 
occ title	Standard Occupational Classification title or OEWS specific title for the occupation
o_group	Contains "detailed" if this is the detail SOC occupation,  "major" if this is a SOC major group occupation, and "total' if it is a cross occupational industry and state total.
tot_emp	Estimated total employment rounded to the nearest 10 (excludes self-employed).
emp_prse ¹	Percent relative standard error for the employment. Relative Standard Error (RSE) is a measure of the reliability of a statistic; the smaller the relative standard error, the more precise the estimate.
pct_total	Percent of industry employment in the given occupation. Percents may not total to 100 due to occupational data not reported. Avoid double counting by excluding major occupation groups.  
h_mean	Mean hourly wage
a_mean	Mean annual wage 
mean_prse ¹	Percent relative standard error for the mean wage. Relative Standard Error (RSE) is a measure of the reliability of a statistic; the smaller the relative standard error, the more precise the estimate.
h_pct10	Hourly 10th percentile wage
h_pct25	Hourly 25th percentile wage
h_median	Hourly median wage (or the 50th percentile)
h_pct75	Hourly 75th percentile wage

annual 	Contains 1 if only the annual wages are released.  The OEWS program only releases the annual wage for some occupations that typically work fewer than 2080 hours per year but are paid on an annual basis, such as teachers, pilots, and athletes.
hourly 	Contains 1 if only the hourly wages are released.  Some occupations, such as actors, dancers, and musicians and singers are paid hourly and generally don't work a standard 2080 hour work year. 
	
Notes:	
¹ Relative Standard Error (RSE) is a measure of the reliability of a statistic; the smaller the relative standard error, the more precise the estimate	
*  = indicates that a wage estimate is not available	
**  = indicates that an employment estimate is not available	
# = indicates a wage that is equal to or greater than $115.00 per hour or $239,200 per year	
~ = indicates a percent total less than 0.05% 	


# More questions

    1) Sort the sheet to find the highest and lowest hourly wage for Texas and then for Houston. Take a look at the list. What surprised you?
```{r}
# Clean h_mean column
texas_clean <- texas |>
  mutate(h_mean = as.numeric(h_mean)) |>  # convert, coercing "*" to NA
  filter(!is.na(h_mean))                  # drop NA values

# Highest hourly wage
texas_clean |> arrange(desc(h_mean)) |> head()

# Lowest hourly wage
texas_clean |> arrange(h_mean) |> head()
```
```{r}
houston_clean <- houston |>
  clean_names() |>  
  mutate(
    hourly_mean = as.numeric(hourly_mean_wage),
    annual_mean = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", annual_mean_wage_2))
  ) |>
  filter(!is.na(hourly_mean))

# Highest 5 paid
houston_clean |> arrange(desc(hourly_mean)) |> head(5)

# Lowest 5 paid
houston_clean |> arrange(hourly_mean) |> head(5)
```

    2) The "All Occupations" entry summarizes the Texas workforce. Find the average annual salary for all occupations. 
    Count how many occupations are below that average and how many above? 
    How could that be a story?
  
```{r}
 texas_clean <- texas |>
  filter(!a_mean %in% c("*", "#")) |>   
  mutate(
    a_mean = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", a_mean))
  )

texas_avg_salary <- texas_clean |>
  filter(occ_title == "All Occupations") |>
  pull(a_mean)

above_avg <- sum(texas_clean$a_mean > texas_avg_salary, na.rm = TRUE)
below_avg <- sum(texas_clean$a_mean < texas_avg_salary, na.rm = TRUE)

c(above_avg = above_avg, below_avg = below_avg)

```

  
    3) Filter for journalists. 
    --Apply Filter to OCC_Code. 
    --Select Filter by Condition. 
    --Select Text contains. 
    --Type in "journalists" and apply
    How does that annual salary compare to the state average?
    How could that be a story?
    
    4) Examine the OCC_CODE column. The occupations ending in "0000" are occupational categories. Filter OCC_CODE for "0000" and examine the 23  occupational categories.
    --Apply Filter to OCC_Code. 
    --Select Filter by Condition. 
    --Select Text contains. 
    --Type in -0000 and apply
    You now will have a list of the 23 occupational categories
  
    
    How could this be a story?

#Storytelling with Local GDP Data  


The rest of this tutorial is adapted from a presentation I made in 2023:
https://profrobwells.github.io/Visualizing_State_Local_Economy/WSJ_Merrill_GDP.html

Go through the following and adapt it to Houston and Texas

<br> 

GDP tells us if the economy is great or if it sucks.

It's the **Big Daddy of economic indicators**.

What is Gross Domestic Product? It measures the value of all final goods and services produced in the country in a year. 

For example: that would be all of the stuff sold by Walmart and all of the beer sold by Liquor Barn and all of the gas pumped at Citgo, etc., AND A WHOLE LOT MORE, over a year.

You get the idea.

You can break it down to a state or a region, and also break it down into three month periods.

As a reporter, you can use local GDP data to figure out what business sectors are doing well and which ones stink. It can lead you to excellent stories.

This section will analyze the storytelling possibilities with the Gross Domestic Product by County data. 

[Check out the local GDP press release](https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_metro/gdp_metro_newsrelease.htm){target="_blank"}

> What's in the GDP data   

"Gross domestic product (GDP) by metropolitan area is the sub-state counterpart of the Nation's gross domestic product (GDP), the Bureau's featured and most comprehensive measure of U.S. economic activity. GDP by metropolitan area is derived as the sum of the GDP originating in all the industries in the metropolitan area.  

Contributions to growth are an industry's contribution to the state's overall percent change in real GDP. The contributions are additive and can be summed to the state's overall percent change. The statistics of GDP by metropolitan area released today are consistent with statistics of GDP by state.

GDP at chained volume measure is adjusted for the effect of inflation to give a measure of ‘real GDP’."

**Data limitations**  

This data series lags significantly. We are working with 2021 data, the most recent available. But it is still the best you can get and you can't beat the price.

### Retrieve GDP Data 
<br>
<br> 
![ ](../data/Images-Houston/BEA_GDP_2023_1.png)
<br>
<br> 

> [Click here to download the Excel tables](https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/lagdp1224.xlsx){target="_blank"}

You should have a **file named "lagdp1224.xlsx"** downloaded. Open it up.

<br>

> Let's see what we have.   
    * One table of data.   
    * 3,223 rows with county data.    
    * GDP for four years, percentage change, and state ranking.

<br> 
For this exercise, cut down the table to Texas-only data. 


#### Walk through the GDP table:

Inflation adjusted GDP, chained to 2012.
Dollar amounts in thousands

This is cool because it has the percentage change growth, 2019/2021, and ranks it. 

> Let's interrogate this table a bit.   


    1--Sort counties according to total GDP in 2021
    2--Sort counties according to 2021_pct_rank_state 
    
    Were you surprised to see the top county by GDP?
    How are the lists different? 
    What are some potential stories?
    
    3--Next, look for the losers. Which counties saw declines in 2021 GDP? 

<br>  

> **Question: What is the basic number for comparison with percentage GDP growth in 2021? In other words, what is the benchmark metric? **


<br>

# Nerd Corner - Advanced Users. 

* If you are good with this tutorial, then you can go back to the BEA website, look at the Regional Economic Accounts page and grab data for [income trends per county since 1969](https://apps.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm){target="_blank"}.   

* Or you can look for data on [industry-specific sector growth](https://apps.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm){target="_blank"}    

  Select Personal Income (State and Local) and then "CAEMP25N: Total Full-Time and Part-Time Employment by NAICS Industry." This is a huge dataset and you can track county level employment in any of these sectors:
    + Arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services   
    + Construction  
    + Durable-goods manufacturing   
    + Educational services, health care, and social assistance   
    + Finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing   
    + Government   
    + Information	 
    + Professional and business services 
    + Trade
